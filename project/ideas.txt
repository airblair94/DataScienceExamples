Big Picture visualizations:
    Make clustering based on:
	-Seebeck
	-Resistivity
    Node size is the Power factor
    Color is the family
    Maybe make a clustering for each of the different temperatures

    
    
    
    Heat Map:
	Temperatures are the rings on the inside
	The labels on the outside are the family's
	Can change what it is showing on different properties
