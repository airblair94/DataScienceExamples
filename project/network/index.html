	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<p> To make the network displayed above, I first found the 5
	nearest neighbors to each point (or compound) using a kdtree. 
	I then linked each point to its nearest neighbors, regardless
	of whether or not it was a mutual relationship. Once I had this
	graph like structure, I was able to perform the pagerank 
	algorithm to the graph, to determine the importance of each of
	the points. The relative importance of each of the points is
	marked by the size of the point, the bigger the point is
	represented on the network above.</p>
	<p> You can more closely examine the network represented above
	by single clicking on a point to see its attributes and then
	double clicking on it to isolate that point and its connections.       Once you isolate a point, you can then "focus" or double click
	on another node to see all of its connections, as well as the
	already focused node, and so on as you desire.</p>
