We should filter based on the Seebeck coefficient and the conductivity

Look to add filtering based on the categorical data
    -Family
    -Final Form
    -Temperature
    -Preparitive Route

Check the results of our data against a random set of data to see if there is any difference.
    1. We establish the range of values for each column
    2. Randomly select from that range and fill in that data
    3. Run our analysis on that random data set and see if the results are similar to the one's
       received by our data.

Analysis:
    -Look at linear regressions of different properties for data points within the same cluster
    -Column C is the electrical resistivity
	-electrical conductivity = 1/resistivity
    -Column D is the Seebeck Coefficient
    -Column I is the Power factor ( or (Column D)^2/(Column C))
	-The ability of a material to produce useful electrical power is quantified by its power
	 factor
	-Materials with high power factor are able to generate more energy in a space-constrained
	 application, but they are not necessarily efficient
