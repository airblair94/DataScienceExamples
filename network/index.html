	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<p>
	The above is a representation of my facebook friend network,
	as of April 16th, 2014. The size of the nodes are
	representitive of their pagerank value, as calculated by 
	the pagerank formula.
	</p>
	<p>
	The network shows that I have 3 main clusterings of friends,
	those from highschool, from college and from the summer camp I
	attended/worked at. The biggest nodes in the graph are people
	that have overlap between these groups, and because of this
	my brother is the biggest node on the graph because he went to
	my highschool and the same summer camp. A few other people have
	this same property and are similarily just as big.
