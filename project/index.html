	    <h2>What is this project?</h2>
	    <p>The nature of thermoelectric phenomena and materials- competing and contraindicated 
	    properties, the complexity and variety of the material systems involved - make it somewhat
	    difficult to develop rational strategies that can lead to significant improvements in 
	    performance. Notwithstanding these difficulties, creative approaches have yielded
	    highly promising materials.</p>
	    <h2>What are we searching for?</h2>
	    <p>There is more to a material than just performance. Given the proposed widespread 
	     application of thermoelectrics and the potential for high-volume use of materials if
	     certain performance targets are reached, they must be composed of elements that are
	     accessible and not in danger of a supply risk.</p>
