        The above visualization represents a clustering of the approximately 9,000 recordings of earthquakes between 1880 and 2013.
	I used the k-centers clustering algorithm to generate the k initial centers and then implemented the k-means algorithm, to make
	the clusters more reliable. I was able to label the clusters using my professors labeling algorithm. From the culmination
	of these techniques, as well as the filtering available, I was able to find some interesting results.
        </p>
	<p>
	Obviously there has been a spike in the number of earthquakes per year in the past 5 to 10 years, however, the interesting
	part of this is where the earthquakes took place. For the first 130 years or so, the earthquakes appear to be fairly evenly
	distributed throughout the state. There is a slight concentration in the bottom center of the state, but it is not unreasonably
	dense. Now, when you move the filter to focus out all earthquakes, except those in the past 5 years, we see that these earthquakes
	are primarily concentrated in the center of the state (slightly to the top center). Therefore, assuming that the first 130 years
	of recording earthquakes represent a natural distribution of them across the state, we see that there has been a sharp, unnatural
	flux in the top center of the state. Since there exists this flux, we are led to believe that this was not natural and thus
	caused by an outside influence.
	</p>
	<p>
	Not only can we see that there has been an increase in the past 5 years, our clustering confirms this. Also, our clustering also tells
	us that the recent earthquakes have been of relatively shallow depth, something that could give us even more clues as to the
	origin of the recent earthquake problems. So from this we can see that the location of the earthquakes has been changed both in
	how their region of the state, but also in their epicenter depth.
	</p>
	<p>
	Now that we have identified a clear digression from the natural pattern, not only in frequency but also in location, we must
	examine its relation to the injection well sites, which can be overlayed on the map. What we can see from this is that even though
	there is a large concentration of the sites in the middle of the state, where we observed the spike, there are other sites that
	do not have earthquake epicenters in a close radius of the site. Also, we lack data on the date of the creation of the injection
	well sites, so we cannot draw anything definite from our data.
	</p>
	<p>
	In conclusion, using the data that we have, there does not appear to be a clear correlation between the location of the injection
	well sites and the epicenters of multiple earthquakes. However, there is also a geographic part to the recent flux in earthquakes
	which could be due to other factors in the northern part of the state. I would recommend that more research be done in this
	northern area, since there does seem to be such a strong deviation from the natural tendencies of the past 130 years.
