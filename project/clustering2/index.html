	<p>
	To analyze the thermo electric data set, I used the kmeans algorithm to cluster it. To find the initial centers for the kmeans
	algorithm, I used the k-centers algorithm, to make sure I have atleast a 2 approximation of the actual centers. To actually find
	k I use the elbow method, where I find the largest jump in the variance between one clustering and another.
	</p>
        <p>
        Clearly there are some distinct clusterings within this data and some patterns arise when we filter these clusterings based
	on different attributes. Unfortuanately, the actual clustering that you see each time the page is loaded, varies fairly
	widely based on the point that is selected randomly to be the first initial center. However, an acceptable clustering arises
	within 1 or 2 refreshes of the page. I have selected to filter based on the Seebeck coefficient and the kappa ZT.
        </p>
	<p>
	When you begin to filter with the Seebeck, you will notice that the amount of data points within a 200 uV/K range spikes every
	100 uV/K. This seems to indicate that the Seebeck numbers are broken into relatively discrete sections. As for the relationship	
	between the Seebeck number and the power factor, there appears to be an even distribution of values for the power factor, over
	a constant range of Seebeck numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next when we look at the labels for the different clusters that are generated, we can see that temperature plays a large factor
	in the clustering of the data. Therefore, moving forward I would want to look at the relationship between the temperature and all
	of the different columns of data that we have. Especially since we only have data from a few different temperatures.
	</p>
	<p>
	Besides the above, for future analysis, I would like to include the ability to filter based on categorical data, such as the family,
	final form, temperature and preparitive route. This will allow us to search for the optimal arrangement of categorical properties
	and narrow the search field considerably for a better thermo electric
